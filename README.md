## **✨ Features**

* **Search Any Business**
  e.g. “cafes in Dubai”, “gyms in London”, “salons in Toronto”.

* **AI Outreach Messages**
  One click generates a personalized pitch for each lead.

* **Export to CSV**
  Download leads for email campaigns or CRM import.

* **Automatic Fallback Mode**
  When the real-time API can’t return results, the app loads a **random cached dataset** so the UI never breaks.

---

## **⚠️ Important Note About Missing Results**

If the search returns no live data and you see a warning:

> *“We hit the API limit. Showing cached results.”*

That means **the free SerpAPI monthly quota is finished**, not that the app is broken.
Cached data will be used until the quota resets.
